## Description:

This repository serves to store the code and data for reproducing analyses performed in this project.

The folder <a href="https://github.com/marlonecobos/Evol_polygyny/tree/main/Scripts" target="_blank">Scripts</a> contains three files:

-   <a href="https://github.com/marlonecobos/Evol_polygyny/blob/main/Scripts/Complete_process.R" target="_blank">Complete_process.R</a> contains the code to reporduce analysis and figures done in R. 
-   <a href="https://github.com/marlonecobos/Evol_polygyny/blob/main/Scripts/Functions.R" target="_blank">Functions.R</a> contains R functions used in the previous script. 
-   <a href="https://github.com/marlonecobos/Evol_polygyny/blob/main/Scripts/To_run_BayesTraits_analyses.txt" target="_blank">To_run_BayesTraits_analyses.txt</a> is a basic step by step guide to perform analysis in BayesTraits.

The folder <a href="https://github.com/marlonecobos/Evol_polygyny/tree/main/Characters" target="_blank">Characters</a> contains two files:

-   <a href="https://github.com/marlonecobos/Evol_polygyny/blob/main/Characters/all_characters.csv" target="_blank">all_characters.csv</a> contains the state of the ecological characters for all species considered in our study (based on a existing phylogeny, see below). 
-   <a href="https://github.com/marlonecobos/Evol_polygyny/blob/main/Characters/all_characters_117.csv" target="_blank">all_characters_117.csv</a> the state of the ecological characters for an extended group of species considered for an analysis in our study (based on a phylogeny extended based on unresolved tips, see below).

<br>

The folder <a href="https://github.com/marlonecobos/Evol_polygyny/tree/main/Trees" target="_blank">Trees</a> contains three files:

-   <a href="https://github.com/marlonecobos/Evol_polygyny/blob/main/Trees/raxml108.tre" target="_blank">raxml108.tre</a> is a phylogeny of 108 species of weaverbirds constructed based on Maximum likelihood. 
-   <a href="https://github.com/marlonecobos/Evol_polygyny/blob/main/Trees/BEASTMCC.tre" target="_blank">BEASTMCC.tre</a> is a phylogeny of 108 species of weaverbirds constructed as a Bayesian maximum clade credibility tree. 
-   <a href="https://github.com/marlonecobos/Evol_polygyny/blob/main/Trees/117_beast_Rmodified.tre" target="_blank">117_beast_Rmodified.tre</a> is a the Bayesian phylogeny modified to consider other species (as unresolved tips), not included in the previous phylogenies.
